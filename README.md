# Internal-Bloons-Tower-Defense-5-Trainer
A small and shitty internal trainer I made For Bloons TD5 whilst learning internal c++ game hackin. 
This project is using the universal opengl 2 hook (hence the name of the folders). 
Please do not roast my shitty c++ code; it's my first ever real c++ project.
