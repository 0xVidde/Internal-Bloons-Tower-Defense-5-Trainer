# Internal-Bloons-Tower-Defense-5-Trainer
        IMPORTANT : If the trainer does not work then it's because you need to update the offsets  
        (I will probably update the offsets when a update comes out but don't be too dependent on that)

A small and shitty internal trainer I made For Bloons TD5 whilst learning internal c++ game hacking. 
This project is using the universal opengl 2 hook (hence the name of the folders). 
Please do not roast my shitty c++ code; it's my first ever real c++ project.
